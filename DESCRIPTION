Description: This package provides functions for doubly robust estimation of the survival curve with time-varying covariates for an iid sample. Covariates are collected at fixed time points (check-in times); event and censoring are actively monitored so that time to event/censoring (whichever occurs first) is observed. Functions can estimate P(T>t|T>t0,H=h0) for multiple values of t, where t0 is a check in time, h0 is a subset of covariates available up to t0, and t>t0 is a fixed time. The user may set t0 to be the entry time and h0 to be empty in order to estimate the marginal survival probability.
